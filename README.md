- Why did you build this project? I built this project to challenge myself and understand how to utilize different elements and how to incorporate them. Starting from scratch and building a code that is stable and user friendly. 
- What problem does it solve? Problem it solves it creates a network where developers can ask each other questions and reply to each other, feeding off their comments and developing themselves. 
- What did you learn? I learned the value of building code from scratch and the esstianals for mysql and heroku and different aspects of visual studios. 

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. First I had to research proper elements of mysql and init install to get all the required files then I had to write some code for app.js and make sure it was well incorporated with the other files and linked up then try and create a server that was stable, along with trying to create logins and save them to datebade and try to deploy to heroku.
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here. Sections divided into about me, work, projects and contact.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
